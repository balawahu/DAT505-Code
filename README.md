Rotation and angle of objects can be controlled by players on X,Y and Z.Colors of different objects will change in every angle.I want to practise what I learnt at that time.Further more,in other angles player will just see different cubes in different colors but every objects will consist of a new square in special angle.Two rings moving around them are aim to show
"round sky and square earth" which is a proverb in ancient time.
