Conclusion of DAT505

08/04/2019

From the first to the third week we start the course about the code way of digital media art. design  During this class I learnt a lot about how to create a work especially by three.js. It impressed me a lot.  

For the first reason, this course provide a valuable place for me to know about a new way to make art works and express ideas. I find that many wonderful scenes are based on simple codes and process is not very difficult. In the past I used to think that they all need complicated codes and a large number of files.Actually they can be simplified.Also,as the development of technology three.js impore some disadvantages so that it can implement more functions.

The second reason is that foundation plays an important   role in this area.We study fundamental knowlege such as how to crate an oject and decide the rotation speed in first week. The process develops orderly and we gradually understand what do the codes mean.For example,'cubes[i].scale.x=(Math.random() -2)+1;' means define the scale x for group cubes which includes many objects on random.One result can be realized by different codes. For example, when we plan to create a skybox we can write different codes in index.js such as create skybox directly and load textures or create geometry,material,cubeshader and others.To be more specific, one result can also be realized in different ways such as to add the background we can load both panorama and skybox.These basic knowledge decide a lot in following process.

The third reason is that I often meet difficulties when I make works. When pages say there may be some mistakes in code which make codes stop running. I usually need to spend some time to find the wrong codes and find solutions. Although it always takes a long time but it is still a good experience for me to accumulate and learn new knowledge.At the same time it is a good chance to communicate with classmates,we share our ideas and find solutions to overcome challenges together.

Codes have high requirements in logic respect and they can not tolerate any mistakes even one word. This is a new area for me because I am not good at these so that I attempt to overcome every mistakes and know the principle of different codes.Three.js is an necessary ability for us so that I need to devote more for it. In the third class I make the first  work to show my ideas by three.js.

Rotation and angle of objects can be controlled by players on X,Y and Z.Colors of different objects will change in every angle.I want to practise what I learnt at that time.Further more,in other angles player will just see different cubes in different colors but every objects will consist of a new square in special angle.Two rings moving around them are aim to show
"round sky and square earth" which is a proverb in ancient time.

In conclusion,three.js is a valuable platform to express things and art.Despite that I was not familiar with it I will try my best to learn from website and other outstanding works to enrich knowledge and create art works.
